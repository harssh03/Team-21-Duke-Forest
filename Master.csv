* extremely difficult to locate boards/tins, esp after first 2-3 sets; W7 is the most ""hidden"" among vegetation
* placement of marking tape on tree branches would help greatly in board/tin sitings

UNRESOLVED - I cannot confirm the species ID of the snake at 8_T2, using the photo provided. However, I think worm snake is a good guess.

RED-BACKED SALAMANDER ENTRY ISSUES:
Originally, the redbacked salamanders found were all listed as one occurrence. The data entry showed 15 Red-backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus) - Lead-backed morph  tallied. The transect locations were then all listed in the same entry: 8_W3, 8_W5, 8_W7, 8_W8, 8_W9. I have done my best to correct this based on the information from the scanned data sheet, and separated each transect coverboard into a separate entry. Additionally, not all of the redbacked salamanders found were indeed the lead back morph, from cross-checking with the photos. The species ID has now been resolved.

Issues for 8_W7 and 8_W8 entries for P. cinereus: According to the datasheet, there were four P. cinereus found at coverboard 8_W7. However, only one photo was taken, showing one salamander. I can't confirm that all 4 occurrences of P. cinereus at 8_W7 are red-backed morph. The one photo available indeed shows the red-backed morph. It was originally incorrectly grouped with all the other entries, and listed as a led-backed morph.
The exact same issue as above occurred for 8_W8 entry.

Issue for 8_W9 entry for P. cinereus:  According to the datasheet, there were five P. cinereus found at coverboard 8_W9. However, only one photo was taken, showing 1 red-backed morph and 2 led-backed morphs. I can't confirm what the remaining occurrences of P. cinereus were, whether red- or led-backed. All 5 occurrences at 8_W9 were originally grouped with all the other entries, and listed as a led-backed morph. Thus, I made the executive decision to say there were 4 led-backed morphs and 1 red-backed morph at this coverboard.",,,,,,,,,,

The volunteers originally submitted the wrong file for their Data Sheet upload. It is now corrected in this spreadsheet and in the Data Sheets file folder on the Duke Forest S:drive.
See ""2022.03.3_C-1_with Admin Notes.docx"", for the copy of the Photo document with my markups. Explains the below notes:

If we see evidence, e.g. ant tunnels, but no ants actually present, is this to be included in the percentage estimation?  Some of what we observed seemed to be abandoned ant tunnels. Who knows how long, or even if abandoned and whether or not an abandoned ant area has any impact on the presence of herpes. It seems complicated.","MCH corresponded with Nicki Cagle about this questions, and addressed this question with volunteers on MS Teams as such: 
""I think you all are doing the right thing in just counting the live, active ants, but here's my one additional thought: If the ants seem to be entering and exiting from a mound that is located beneath a coverboard, I would include that in your estimation. For example, if there's a pile of dirt or sandy material beneath the coverboard with entrance/exit holes where live ants are actively going in and out of, to me that shows that they are clearly using that area as their colony. The colony they've made and are using is thus actively disturbing some of the ground surface underneath the coverboard, and thus affecting the herps' experience at that coverboard.

Hi Salamanders (diane.allen030 (Guest), Bill.Boyarsky (Guest), sungardener (Guest), corneliasarvey (Guest), bernie.carreno (Guest), tandycat (Guest)),

I'm wondering if you can share more information about the Redbelly Snake (Storeria occipitomaculata) that you observed during your 3/5/2023 visit to transect 48-1. It would be great to add some color commentary to our data entry about this snake, especially since you were unable to get a photograph of it. I'm not familiar with that species myself. What types of markings are identifying characteristics did you observe that led to ID-ing it as a Redbelly Snake?

I'm also tagging Nicolette L Cagle, Ph.D., Sara Childs, and Blake Tedder in here, just so there aware that one of these snakes was observed.

Thanks! - Maggie

    Hi Maggie, two of the team saw part of the snake under the edge of a leaf (which blocked my view from where I was standing).  They both were sure it had a red belly, dark dorsal (ref: https://herpsofnc.org/red-bellied-snake/).  They did not see the neck.  Unfortunately it dove for cover before the rest of us could get a look.  I'll let them add any additional details.
​[3/8 3:59 PM] diane.allen030 (Guest)
    Bill’s description correct. It was coiled up, partially under a leaf. Coiled size maybe slightly larger than the size of a quarter. Solid dark gray dorsum and pale-ish coral red abdomen. Probably saw over 3/4 of length, but neither neck or head. Not a quick moving snake, but was very near the corner of the cover board where Heather and I were standing. So no one else got a good look
​[3/8 4:02 PM] diane.allen030 (Guest)
    I would say the scales were smooth, but I wasn’t thinking about them at the time
​[3/8 8:44 PM] diane.allen030 (Guest)
    Reviewing my snake book, I think maybe we should back off the Id of this one. We got a good look at it, but no picture and we never saw the head. It could also be a juvenile worm snake, if they can be almost black on top with a reddish belly. Heather? Any thoughts?
​[3/10 7:42 AM] diane.allen030 (Guest)
    
Consulted with Heather (the other Salamander who observed this snake. We saw a tiny blackish snake with a red belly. I came across this picture in my snake book: Heather agreed that the snake we saw might have been a specimen like the photo, except a lot smaller.

    So, to be absolutely certain of our data, we are going to change the id to unidentified snake. Maggie Heraty, do I change it on my end or how does that process work? Thanks! Diane
​[3/10 8:38 PM] Maggie Heraty
    Hi all. I can change it on my end. I think I will just mark this as “snake (unidentified)” since it sounds like we can’t be absolutely sure. Thanks for sharing your thoughts here, y’all!

    So, to be absolutely certain of our data, we are going to change the id to unidentified snake. Maggie Heraty, do I change it on my end or how does that process work? Thanks! Diane
​[3/10 8:38 PM] Maggie Heraty
    Hi all. I can change it on my end. I think I will just mark this as “snake (unidentified)” since it sounds like we can’t be absolutely sure. Thanks for sharing your thoughts here, y’all!

Hi Salamanders (diane.allen030 (Guest), Bill.Boyarsky (Guest), sungardener (Guest), corneliasarvey (Guest), bernie.carreno (Guest), tandycat (Guest)),

I'm wondering if you can share more information about the Redbelly Snake (Storeria occipitomaculata) that you observed during your 3/5/2023 visit to transect 48-1. It would be great to add some color commentary to our data entry about this snake, especially since you were unable to get a photograph of it. I'm not familiar with that species myself. What types of markings are identifying characteristics did you observe that led to ID-ing it as a Redbelly Snake?

I'm also tagging Nicolette L Cagle, Ph.D., Sara Childs, and Blake Tedder in here, just so there aware that one of these snakes was observed.

Thanks! - Maggie

    Hi Maggie, two of the team saw part of the snake under the edge of a leaf (which blocked my view from where I was standing).  They both were sure it had a red belly, dark dorsal (ref: https://herpsofnc.org/red-bellied-snake/).  They did not see the neck.  Unfortunately it dove for cover before the rest of us could get a look.  I'll let them add any additional details.
​[3/8 3:59 PM] diane.allen030 (Guest)
    Bill’s description correct. It was coiled up, partially under a leaf. Coiled size maybe slightly larger than the size of a quarter. Solid dark gray dorsum and pale-ish coral red abdomen. Probably saw over 3/4 of length, but neither neck or head. Not a quick moving snake, but was very near the corner of the cover board where Heather and I were standing. So no one else got a good look

    I would say the scales were smooth, but I wasn’t thinking about them at the time
​[3/8 8:44 PM] diane.allen030 (Guest)
    Reviewing my snake book, I think maybe we should back off the Id of this one. We got a good look at it, but no picture and we never saw the head. It could also be a juvenile worm snake, if they can be almost black on top with a reddish belly. Heather? Any thoughts?

    So, to be absolutely certain of our data, we are going to change the id to unidentified snake. Maggie Heraty, do I change it on my end or how does that process work? Thanks! Diane

    Hi all. I can change it on my end. I think I will just mark this as “snake (unidentified)” since it sounds like we can’t be absolutely sure. Thanks for sharing your thoughts here, y’all!

    Thanks! That is best.

This is the 2nd data entry out of 2 total for this particular transect visit.

No percentage estimate for the Black Ants at C-1_W9 and C-1_W10 was provided in the original data entry by Kelly Bruno. When I (Maggie Heraty) reached out to her for more information about it, she said on 5/10/2023: ""I am so sorry I don’t remember, but from what I remember, the majority of black ant colonies at C-1 were less than 50%.

    Hi Gregory Beck and Susan Pratt, 
Quick question for you both. I am finally getting back to quality controlling the June data, and I noticed that during a visit that you both conducted along with Lauren West on 6/17, there's a comment on the datasheet about ants that's a bit confusing. See attached image. ""58% Ants"" is written for Species 2 at T2, but there wasn't any ant data submitted in the data entry on the Qualtrics form. Do you happen to remember if you indeed saw ants at that coverboard? If so, I'll update our data entry records and write it in as ""Ants (Unidentified)"" for 58%. [R_12bsUdamyWulysW_2023.06.17_4_Datasheet.jpg] 
Thanks so much for your help! Maggie

    Hi Gregory Beck (Guest) and Susan Pratt - I'm just checking back in about this again! Let me know if you're able to remember smile
​[7/25 12:59 PM] Susan Pratt
    I don't think we would have written 58% smile ..so I would guess it is supposed to be 50%. Greg?
​[9/7 11:58 AM] Maggie Heraty
    Hi Gregory Beck (Guest) - let me know if you have any thoughts about this still.
​[9/7 11:59 AM] Maggie Heraty
For now, I am updating our data records to show the following:
Ants (Unidentified), 4_T2, 50%,  n
If I don't hear back from Greg, we'll just leave it at that!
​[9/8 2:44 PM] Gregory Beck (Guest)
    Sorry I didn't read the original message, Maggie. I can't recall whether or not I saw ants. But I wouldn't bet against it.",,,,,,,,,,

Their answers suggested that the size of the skink was large, suggestive of an adult Broadhead Skink. Here are their comments:
[7/10 4:49 PM] Sarah Fowler (Guest)
    It was a much larger size than a 5 lined skink
​[7/11 11:02 AM] Bill Boyarsky (Guest)
    Image in the salamander files ID'ed by date and gate.   Agree with Sarah, it was significantly larger than 5 line skinks.  After an immediate exit from the tin, it posed for all of us to get a good look and lots of images.
​[7/12 11:46 AM] Maggie Heraty
    Awesome, thanks for that info, y'all! By any chance, do you have an estimate of how long (from nose to tail tip) the skink was in inches? I'd love to include that in our data records smile

However, in my (Maggie Heraty's) review of the photos, both toads appear to be American Toads. For the 1st toad: This toad has visible/pronounced cranial crests and post-orbital ridges, which connect to the paratoid gland by a short spur. From what I can see, it also has only 1-2 warts per spot. These are both characteristics attributed to American Toads; For the 2nd toad: This toad has visible cranial crests and post-orbital ridges, which connect to the paratoid gland by a short spur. This toad also has an enlarged wart on the tibia. All of these characteristics are attributed to American Toads. It does appear that some spots might have 3 warts within it (typical of Fowler’s), but most have just 1-2 warts per spot (typical of American).

Nicolette L Cagle, Ph.D., I'd love your eyes on both the Two-Lined Salamander and the unidentified salamander (we think it was a Lead Morph red-backed sally, but it was difficult to tell). If you have the chance to take a look at the photos in the Photo document attached, I'd love your expert opinion! FYI - on the unidentified salamander, I was able to get a photo of part of its body, which included a close-up on it's ribs - I have a memory of you saying in the past that those can be helpful for identification?
[10/5/2023 6:57 PM] Nicolette L Cagle, Ph.D.
I love this two-lined! It's gorgeous and I concur with the ID. Regarding the little guy, I think lead morph red-backed fits the bill. I tried counting costal grooves, but I couldn't see them all (but they can be super helpful with ID - slimies typically have 16 costal grooves, redbacks typically have 18-20), and given the size, red-backed wins the day!",,,,,,,,,,

    Hey Maggie Heraty! My husband said that he checked the cover boards of C-2 yesterday with a Duke group (he’s part of the MF/MEM group in the Nicholas School). Do you still want us to check that transect tomorrow, or since it was just done yesterday should we skip tomorrow’s check?
​[10/7 5:16 PM] Emma Blackford (Guest)
    It sounds like they didn’t record the data, so presumably we still need to check? Do you want us to make note that the boards were flipped 2 days prior and that that might have impacted what we find?
​[10/10 1:16 PM] Maggie Heraty
    Hi Emma, I apologize for not responding sooner! I had family in town this weekend, so I was not checking MS teams (or my phone and email much at all). Thank you for letting me know about the MF/MEM group. We did know that they were out there for an annual Dendrology Competition that they lead. However, I was not aware that they were flipping our coverboards. That's unfortunate that they didn't give us advanced notice. However, they were overseen directly by our science advisor, Dr. Nicki Cagle.
​[10/10 1:17 PM] Maggie Heraty
    Did you and Team Frogs still check the boards and record data? That would indeed be best to do still. We want to make sure we have a record of what was out there. You can simply note in the ""comments"" section at the end of the data entry that the boards were recently flipped. (If you've already done this, then thank you!!!)
